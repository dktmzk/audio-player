# Audio Player

**Audio Player** is a customizable audio player designed for repeated listening and practice. It allows users to loop tracks multiple times with individually adjustable speeds for each pass, and features weighted playlist management where subsequent tracks can be selected based on a priority system.

## Key Features

### Advanced Playback
*   **Progressive Speed Loops:** Set different playback speeds for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pass of a track (e.g., 1.0x -> 1.1x -> 1.2x).
*   **A-B Looping (Drill Mode):** Drag on the waveform to create a loop region. This region will **loop infinitely** with your progressive speed settings until you clear it.
*   **Auto-Advance:** In standard playback (no region), the player advances to the next track automatically after your set number of loops.

### Smart Playlist Management
*   **Weighted Shuffle:** A "True Dynamic Shuffle" that picks the next track based on priority. High-priority tracks play significantly more often.
*   **Priority System:** Assign "Low", "Medium", or "High" priority to any track using a slider.
*   **Recent History Sort:** Sort your playlist by "Recent" to instantly find the track you just finished listening to (perfect for adjusting priority on the fly).
*   **Drag & Drop:** Load files instantly by dragging them anywhere onto the screen.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Add Tracks:** Drag MP3/WAV files onto the window or click "Add Files".
2.  **Set Playback Rules:**
    *   Choose how many times a track should repeat (e.g., 2 times).
    *   Set the speed for each pass (e.g., Pass 1: 1.0x, Pass 2: 1.1x).
3.  **Practice:**
    *   **Review Mode:** Just hit Play. Tracks will play X times and auto-advance.
    *   **Drill Mode:** Drag on the waveform to highlight a section. It will loop *forever* at your set speeds until you click "Clear Loop".
4.  **Prioritize:**
    *   Set new/hard tracks to **High Priority**.
    *   Enable **Shuffle** (Blue Icon).
    *   The player will randomly serve you tracks, favoring the High priority ones.
    *   When a track finishes, switch the playlist sort to **"Recent"** to easily lower its priority if you've mastered it.
